# SendGrid Email Setup Guide

## Current Issue
The email notification system is failing with a 403 Forbidden error because SendGrid requires sender email verification.

## Quick Fix for Production

### Option 1: Single Sender Verification (Recommended for testing)
1. Log in to your SendGrid dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication > Single Sender Verification
3. Add and verify the email address: `vanessa.rich@aol.com`
4. Follow the verification steps in your email

### Option 2: Domain Authentication (Recommended for production)
1. Log in to your SendGrid dashboard
2. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication > Domain Authentication
3. Add your domain: `vanessarich.com`
4. Follow the DNS setup instructions

## Alternative: Use Verified Replit Domain
If you want to test immediately, I can configure the system to use a Replit-verified sender domain, but emails will come from a technical address rather than your personal brand.

## Current Configuration
- Sender email: `vanessa.rich@aol.com` (needs verification)
- Admin notification email: `vanessa.rich@aol.com`
- SendGrid API key: Present but sender not verified

## Next Steps
Choose one of the verification options above, and the email notifications will start working immediately.
